TASK 1

Iterating with Async/Await - Async Array Logger
This project demonstrates how to iterate over an array using async/await in JavaScript, introducing a delay between each log operation.

üìÑ Description
The iterateWithAsyncAwait function logs each element of an input array to the console with a 1-second delay between each log. It utilizes asynchronous programming with async/await and JavaScript's setTimeout function to simulate delay.

üß† How It Works
The function takes an array as an argument.

It loops through the array.

For each element, it waits 1 second before logging the value to the console.

This delay is achieved using a Promise wrapped around setTimeout.

üîß Usage
const iterateWithAsyncAwait = async (arr) => {
console.log("Logging each value with a delay of 1 second between logs.");
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
await new Promise((resolve) =>
setTimeout(() => {
console.log(arr[i]);
resolve();
}, 1000)
);
}
};

iterateWithAsyncAwait([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

üí° Example Output
Logging each value with a delay of 1 second between logs.
1
2
3
4
5
Each number is logged to the console one second apart.

üìÅ Requirements
Node.js or a modern browser (for ES6+ support)

‚úÖ Notes
This is useful for learning how to handle asynchronous flows and timed operations in JavaScript. It's also a great introduction to how async/await interacts with Promises.


TASK 2

Awaiting a Call - üß™ Simulated API Call with Async/Await
This project demonstrates how to simulate an asynchronous API call using Promises and async/await in JavaScript.

üìÑ Description
The code simulates a basic API call that takes 2 seconds to respond. It shows how to handle asynchronous behavior using async/await, making the code easy to read and maintain.

üöÄ Features
Simulated API response using a Promise

Asynchronous function that waits for the simulated response

Clear console logs to demonstrate the sequence of operations

üß† How It Works
testApiCall() returns a Promise that resolves with a success message after 2 seconds.

awaitCall() is an asynchronous function that:

Logs "Fetching data..."

Waits for testApiCall() to complete

Logs the received response

üß™ Code Example

// Simulate an API call using a Promise
function testApiCall() {
return new Promise((resolve) => {
setTimeout(() => {
resolve({ message: "Data fetched successfully!" });
}, 2000); // 2 second delay
});
}

// Async function to call the test API
const awaitCall = async () => {
console.log("Fetching data...");
const data = await testApiCall(); // Wait for the test API to resolve
console.log("Response received:", data);
};

// Call the function
awaitCall();

üì¶ Output

Fetching data...
(wait 2 seconds)
Response received: { message: 'Data fetched successfully!' }

üìÅ Requirements
Node.js or any modern browser that supports ES6+ features

‚úÖ Use Cases
Teaching or learning how async/await works

Mocking API behavior in frontend or backend development

Quick prototyping for asynchronous flows


TASK 3

Handling Errors with Async/Await - üß™ Async API Call with Error Handling
This is a basic JavaScript example that simulates an API call using a Promise and handles potential errors using try...catch.

üìã Description
The function testApiCall simulates a delayed API response.

The function awaitCall uses async/await to handle the API response.

If the API call fails, a user-friendly error message is displayed in the console.

üíª Code Example

function testApiCall() {
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
setTimeout(() => {
// Simulate a success
resolve({ message: "Data fetched successfully!" });

      // Simulate an error
      reject(new Error("Failed to fetch data"));
    }, 2000);

});
}

const awaitCall = async () => {
console.log("Fetching data...");
try {
const data = await testApiCall();
console.log("Response received:", data);
} catch (error) {
console.error("Oops! Something went wrong while fetching data. Please try again later.");
console.error("Error details:", error.message);
}
};

awaitCall();

üñ®Ô∏è Sample Output

Fetching data...
Response received: { message: 'Data fetched successfully!' }

Or if an error occurs:

Fetching data...
Oops! Something went wrong while fetching data. Please try again later.
Error details: Failed to fetch data

üìå Note
In the current setup, both resolve and reject are called in the same block ‚Äî only the first one (resolve) will run. To test the error handling, comment out the resolve() line and uncomment the reject() line.
